In the previous section, we built a meeting summarization agent and reviewed the output it generated from a sample conversation transcript.
But how do we assess the quality of that output? Many developers tend to eyeball the results of their LLM applications. This is a common and significant issue in LLM application development.

In this section we are going to see how to evaluate our `MeetingSummarizer` using **DeepEval**, a powerful open-source LLM evaluation framework.

## Defining Evaluation Criteria

Defining evaluation criteria is arguably the most important part of assessing an LLM application's performance. LLM applications are always made with a clear goal in mind, and the evaluation criteria must be defined by taking this goal into consideration. 

The summarization agent we've created processes meeting transcripts and generates a concise summary of the meeting and a list of action items. Our evaluation criteria is directly dependent on these responses which will be generated by our agent. 

- The summaries generated must be concise and contain all important points
- The action items generated must be correct and cover all the key actions

In the previous section, we've updated our summarizer to have different helper functions each for their own tasks. This makes it easier for us to evaluate each task separately.

### Summary Evaluation

We will now write a test suite to evaluate just the summarization part of our summarizer. As mentioned above the criteria for our summary is:

- The summary generated must be concise and contain all important points

This is a use-case-specific criterion, meaning it's custom-tailored for our meeting summarizer. For this we can use `deepeval`'s [`GEval`](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals) metric.
`GEval` is a metric that uses _LLM-as-a-judge_ to evaluate LLM outputs based on **ANY** custom criteria. The `GEval` metric is the most versatile type of metric `deepeval` has to offer, and is capable of evaluating almost any use case.

Here's how you can use `GEval` to evaluate the summary generated by our summarization agent:

```python title="test_summary.py"
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import GEval
from deepeval import evaluate
from meeting_summarizer import MeetingSummarizer # import your summarizer here

with open("meeting_transcript.txt", "r") as file:
    transcript = file.read().strip()

summarizer = MeetingSummarizer(...)
summary, action_items = summarizer.summarize(transcript)

summary_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=transcript, # your full meeting transcript as a string
    actual_output=summary # provide the summary generated by your summarizer here
)

summary_concision = GEval(
    name="Summary Concision",
    # Write your criteria here
    criteria="Assess whether the summary is concise and focused only on the essential points of the meeting? It should avoid repetition, irrelevant details, and unnecessary elaboration.",
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)

evaluate(test_cases=[summary_test_case], metrics=[summary_concision])
```

You can use the following command to run the evaluation

```bash
deepeval test run test_summary.py
```

### Action Item Evaluation

We will now evaluate the action item generation of our summarization agent. As mentioned in the previous section the criteria for our action item evaluation is

- The action items generated must be correct and cover all the key actions

We will be using the `GEval` metric again here because this is also a custom criteria. Here's how you evaluate the action items generated:

```python title="test_action_items.py"
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import GEval
from deepeval import evaluate
from meeting_summarizer import MeetingSummarizer # import your summarizer here

with open("meeting_transcript.txt", "r") as file:
    transcript = file.read().strip()

summarizer = MeetingSummarizer(...)
summary, action_items = summarizer.summarize(transcript)

action_item_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=transcript, # your full meeting transcript as a string
    actual_output=str(action_items) # provide the action items generated by your summarizer here
)

action_item_check = GEval(
    name="Action Item Accuracy",
    # Write your criteria here
    criteria="Are the action items accurate, complete, and clearly reflect the key tasks or follow-ups mentioned in the meeting?",
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)

evaluate(test_cases=[action_item_test_case], metrics=[action_item_check])
```

You can use the following command to run the evaluation

```bash
deepeval test run test_action_items.py
```

## Running Your First Eval

Now that we know our criteria and the metrics we'll be using, we can run our first eval on a single test case to make sure everything's going smoothly.

Here's how you can test your summarization agent:

```python title="test_summarizer.py"
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import GEval
from deepeval import evaluate
from meeting_summarizer import MeetingSummarizer # import your summarizer here

summarizer = MeetingSummarizer()
with open("meeting_transcript.txt", "r") as file:
    transcript = file.read().strip()

summary, action_items = summarizer.summarize(transcript)

summary_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=transcript, # your full meeting transcript as a string
    actual_output=summary # provide the summary generated by your summarizer here
)

action_item_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=transcript, # your full meeting transcript as a string
    actual_output=str(action_items) # provide the action items generated by your summarizer here
)

summary_concision = GEval(
    name="Summary Concision",
    criteria="Assess whether the summary is concise and focused only on the essential points of the meeting? It should avoid repetition, irrelevant details, and unnecessary elaboration.",
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)
action_item_check = GEval(
    name="Action Item Accuracy",
    criteria="Are the action items accurate, complete, and clearly reflect the key tasks or follow-ups mentioned in the meeting?",
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)

evaluate(test_cases=[summary_test_case], metrics=[summary_concision])
evaluate(test_cases=[action_item_test_case], metrics=[action_item_check])
```

You can save the above code in a test file named `test_summarizer.py` and run the following code in your terminal to evaluate your summarizer:

```bash
deepeval test run test_summarizer.py
```

You'll see your evaluation results, including scores and reasoning, printed in the console.

:::tip
It is highly recommended that you use [**Confident AI**](https://www.confident-ai.com), `deepeval`'s cloud platform that allows you to view your test results in a much more intuitive way. Here's how you can [set up Confident AI](https://deepeval.com/tutorials/tutorial-setup#setting-up-confident-ai). Or you can simply run the following code in the terminal to set it up yourself:
```bash
deepeval login
```
**It's free to get started!** _(No credit card required.)_

That's how you can run your first eval using `deepeval`.

### Evaluation Results

Here are the results I got after running the evaluation code for a single test case:

| Metric                    | Score | Result |
|---------------------------|-------|--------|
| Summary Concision         | 0.7   | Fail   |
| Action Item Accuracy      | 0.8   | Fail   |

**DeepEval**'s metrics provide a reason for their evaluation of a test case, which allows you to debug your LLM application easily on why certain test cases pass or fail. Below are the reasons provided by `deepeval`'s `GEval` for the above evaluation result:

For summary:


> The Actual Output effectively identifies the key points of the meeting, covering the issues with the assistant's performance, the comparison between GPT-4o and Claude 3, the proposed hybrid approach, and the discussion around confidence metrics and tone. It omits extraneous details and is significantly shorter than the Input transcript. There's minimal repetition. However, while concise, it could be *slightly* more reduced; some phrasing feels unnecessarily verbose for a summary (e.g., 'Ethan and Maya discussed... focusing on concerns').

For action items: 

> The Actual Output captures some key action items discussed in the Input, specifically Maya building the similarity metric and setting up the hybrid model test, and Ethan syncing with design. However, it misses several follow-ups, such as exploring 8-bit embedding quantization and addressing the robotic tone of the assistant via prompt tuning. While the listed actions are clear and accurate, the completeness is lacking. The action items directly correspond to tasks mentioned, but not all tasks are represented.

## Understanding Eval Results

Let's understand how the evaluation happened and why our test cases failed. `GEval` by `deepeval` is a custom metric that can be used to evaluate **ANY** custom criteria of a use case. This metric uses _LLM-as-a-judge_ to evaluate the results of the test case.

If we look at the test cases and metrics we've provided for evaluation:

```python
summary_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=transcript, # your full meeting transcript as a string
    actual_output=summary # provide the summary generated by your summarizer here
)

action_item_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=transcript, # your full meeting transcript as a string
    actual_output=str(action_items) # provide the action items generated by your summarizer here
)

summary_concision = GEval(
    name="Summary Concision",
    criteria="Assess whether the summary is concise and focused only on the essential points of the meeting? It should avoid repetition, irrelevant details, and unnecessary elaboration.",
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)

action_item_check = GEval(
    name="Action Item Accuracy",
    criteria="Are the action items accurate, complete, and clearly reflect the key tasks or follow-ups mentioned in the meeting?",
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)
```

We can see that we are supplying our **_transcript_** as `input`s and the **_summary_** or **_action items_** generated as the `actual_output`s in our test cases. Now `GEval` uses it's corresponding `criteria` which we've supplied, as guidelines to be followed while evaluating our test cases.

This means a new LLM (our evaluation model) is going to check our `input`s and `actual_output`s (_our evaluation parameters supplied in the metric initialization_) against the `criteria` mentioned. This is similar to how you would evaluate the responses yourself, but through an LLM. 

This new LLM assesses the quality of the `actual_output` against the `input` depending on the `criteria` mentioned. After assessing the test case, the evaluation model provides a `score` and `reason` explaining the evaluation results. If the score is below the `threshold` supplied in the metric, the test case is deemed fail, and success otherwise. (_The default threshold is 0.5 for most test cases in `deepeval`_)

These reasons explain why the test cases failed, and help us identify exactly what needs to be fixed. Click here to learn more about [how `GEval` works.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/g-eval-the-definitive-guide)

It is advised to use a good evaluation model for better results and reasons. Your evaluation model should be well-suited for the task it's evaluating.
Some models like `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `claude-3-opus` are best for summarization evaluations.
