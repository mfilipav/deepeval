    "question": "can stress cause hair fall?",
    "question_text": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHi doctor,\nMy girlfriend is 20 years old. She recently started losing her hair. Now, within two and a half months you can see her scalp near the front of her head and the very back of her head. It happened suddenly. And now she is pulling her hair out in clumps throughout the day. I have also noticed that her eyes are very dark and she complaints of being tired. She does not sleep well at night either. Her job has been stressing her out lately. She is working as a teacher for the past two years and managing kindergarten kids. What I really want to know is, can there be such a rapid hair loss due to\u00a0stress of her job?\u00a0Or is it something worse? I have almost ruled out thyroid. She is perfectly healthy. I have a thyroid problem and her symptoms are not similar to mine. And it does not run in the family too. Please help with her problem.\t\t\t\t",
