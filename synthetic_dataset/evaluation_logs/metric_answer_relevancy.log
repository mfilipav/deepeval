Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1-mini, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the user's concern about medical abortion after a previous surgical abortion without including any irrelevant information. It is clear, focused, and fully relevant to the input., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: i had a surgical-abortion a year ago now am pregnant again but this time iam thinking of having a medical-abortion. is my medical-abortion going to have any trouble because i had a surgical abortion a year ago?
  - actual output: Having had a surgical abortion a year ago generally doesn't cause problems with having a medical abortion now. Medical abortion is usually safe and effective even if you've had previous abortions. However, because every case is unique, especially with your health factors like BMI and history, it's best to discuss this with your healthcare provider to ensure it's the safest option for you. They can provide personalized advice and support.
  - expected output: the term medical abortion is used when a medicine is given in order to perform a chemically induced abortion. the results are better if the medication is given earlier. there are various medications that might be used. most of the women would abort within hours but it can also take up to several weeks to complete the abortion. the complications are usually rare. anyway a prolonged bleeding might occur that will need a suction. most doctors and researcher agree that a prior surgical abortion is not a contraindication for a medical abortion. however the medical abortion has to be advised and led by a doctor after a complete examination of the woman.

For test case:

  - input: can i become pregnant after having intercourse during my period?
  - actual output: Yes, it's possible to become pregnant from intercourse during your period, though it's less likely. Sperm can survive up to 5 days, and if you have a shorter cycle like yours (24 days), ovulation can happen soon after your period ends, increasing the chance of pregnancy. If you're trying to avoid pregnancy, using protection is a good idea. If you want more personalized advice, consider talking to a healthcare provider.
  - expected output: if you are having normal periods (4-5 days) that you usually have then you can never become pregnant by having unprotected sex during your periods. however you have a short of 24 days and menstruate for 7 days, then you need to be careful on the last 2 days of those 7 days. You have been having lots of sex, so try to be extra careful. I hope this helps.

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1-mini, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the concern about delayed periods and potential early menopause without including any irrelevant information. It is clear, focused, and fully relevant to the input question., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: My period has been delayed for three weeks. Till now they are normally regular. Could it be the early onset of menopause or will the period eventually come?
  - actual output: A three-week delay at age 50 could be due to perimenopause, which is the transition phase before menopause, causing irregular cycles. However, other factors like stress or health changes can also affect your period. Since your cycles have been regular until now, it's a good idea to consult your doctor to rule out any other causes and get personalized advice.
  - expected output: if you have been regular with your menses these years and this is the first episode at 50 years of age when the menses have been delayed by two weeks the causes can be a possible initiation of perimenopausal stage where menses are often delayed for a month or two and slowly tend to stop in next one to two years. perimenopausal stage can be verified with the hormonal fsh (follicle stimulating hormone) and lh (luteinizing hormone) levels which if high shall indicate an onset of perimenopausal stage. however it is suggested that pregnancy should anyways be ruled out and if negative then you can wait naturally for your menses to resume. hence try maintaining a menstrual calendar and keep a mark for your dates duration of flow and quantity to evaluate the possible onset of a perimenopausal state. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist

  - actual output: Hi! Since you've been through menopause and experienced unexpected heavy bleeding, it's really important to follow up with your doctor. Blood tests alone usually aren't enough to rule out all causes, and an internal examination or ultrasound might be needed to check for anything serious. I’d recommend scheduling an appointment with your healthcare provider to get a thorough evaluation. Take care!

For test case:

  - input: I am 38 years old and I am breastfeeding my 1 year old child. I have been diagnosed with bacterial vaginal infection and prescribed metronidazole vaginal cream daily at bedtime for 5 days. Is it safe for me to continue nursing while using that medication?
  - actual output: It's great that you're taking care of your health! Metronidazole vaginal cream is generally considered safe to use while breastfeeding, as only a small amount is absorbed systemically. You can usually continue nursing without interruption. However, if you notice any unusual symptoms in your baby or have concerns, it's best to check with your doctor or pharmacist to be sure.
  - expected output: you have been diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (bacterial vaginal infection). metronidazole cream has to be applied vaginally for cure of the infection. vaginal application leads to absorption of metronidazole but it is only 2% of the oral dose. only a small amount out of this gets into breast milk. your question about the breastfeeding is pertinent but you are going to use the cream only for 5 days. perhaps you can avoid breastfeeding your child during this period. no major study has given a clear answer regarding the safety and ill effects of the drug in such a situation. consult a paediatrician for further follow up regarding an alternative diet for your child during this period.

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1-mini, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response fully addresses the hormonal causes of period acne, contrasts it with acne occurring at other times, and provides effective non-product treatment methods. There are no irrelevant statements, making the answer highly relevant and comprehensive., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What is happening within our body that causes the most stubborn acne when we were on our period? What is the difference between the acne we get while on our period versus off? What are the best ways (besides specific products) to treat acne specifically during that time?
  - actual output: Hey! The stubborn acne around your period is mainly due to hormonal changes. Just before and during your period, your body’s progesterone and androgen levels rise, which can increase oil production in your skin. This excess oil can clog pores and lead to those stubborn pimples. Acne off your period is often less influenced by these hormone fluctuations and might be caused by other factors like stress, diet, or bacteria.

To help manage period-related acne without specific products, you can:
- Keep your skin clean but avoid over-washing.
- Maintain a balanced diet with plenty of water.
- Manage stress through relaxation techniques.
- Get enough sleep.
- Avoid touching your face too much.

If your acne feels severe or painful, it’s a good idea to chat with a dermatologist or doctor for tailored advice.
  - expected output: during menses body releases lots of hormones. these androgens cause stimulation of skin pilosebaceous ducts and lead to acne during the menstruation. these types of acne usually appear in chin area may be because of more concentrated pilosebaceous unit localized to this place. You are also still a teenager, so this is normal to have acne. You could try to maintain hormonal imbalance with the help of antiandrogen to reduce acne during your period, but please consult a dermatologist for further information

For test case:

  - input: Is emergency contraception pill safe while breastfeeding? If not, then what are the alternative measures?
