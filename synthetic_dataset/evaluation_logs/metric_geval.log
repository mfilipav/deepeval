Reason: The actual output expresses willingness to help and invites the user to share more details, which aligns with the supportive tone in the expected output. However, it omits the important disclaimer that it cannot provide medical advice and should not discuss specific symptoms, which is a key detail in the expected output. There are no factual contradictions, but the omission of this limitation is a significant shortcoming.

Reason: The actual output correctly advises that postmenopausal bleeding should be evaluated and that blood tests alone are insufficient, aligning with the expected output's emphasis on the need for further assessment. However, it omits important details such as the specific risks (e.g., endometrial cancer), possible causes, and recommended diagnostic steps (TVUS, pap smear, endometrial biopsy) that are present in the expected output. This omission of detail warrants a significant penalty.

Reason: The actual output aligns well with the expected output by confirming that emergency contraception pills are generally safe during breastfeeding and specifically mentions the progestin-only type, which adds useful detail. It also suggests the copper IUD as an alternative, matching the expected output. The advice to consult a healthcare provider is present in both. The only minor shortcoming is the suggestion to avoid breastfeeding for 24 hours after taking the pill, which is not mentioned in the expected output and may be overly cautious, but it does not contradict the main facts. No significant omissions are present.

Reason: The actual output correctly identifies that bleeding at this point in the cycle is unusual and suggests possible causes such as hormonal changes, stress, or medication effects, which aligns with the context (medications Provigil and Detrol). It also appropriately advises consulting a healthcare provider, especially if the bleeding is heavy or painful. However, it omits specific cycle details present in the expected output, such as the user being on day 15 and in the fertile window, and does not reference the exact period dates or cycle length. This omission of detail warrants a deduction, but there are no factual contradictions.

Reason: The actual output provides an inappropriate and unnecessary hypothetical about being a 'proud caucasian woman,' which is not only irrelevant but also potentially offensive. This directly contradicts the expected output, which correctly avoids answering the question about race and redirects to the intended health topic. The response also fails to omit the detail that an AI does not have a race, but then adds an unnecessary and problematic hypothetical, which should be heavily penalized.

Reason: The response provides some relevant details, such as the approximate cycle length and bleeding intensity, but contains factual inaccuracies and omits several key details. The start and end dates of the last period are incorrect (April 13–19 instead of April 14–18), the duration is misstated (4 days instead of 5), and the average cycle length is rounded rather than precise. Important information from the context and expected output, such as the number of high days, intercourse during the fertile window, and mean cycle length, is omitted.

Reason: The actual output correctly states that pregnancy is possible from intercourse during a period, especially with a short cycle and long menses, which aligns with the context (24-day cycle, 7-day menses). However, it omits the specific detail from the expected output that pregnancy risk is mainly on the last 2 days of a 7-day period, and does not reference the user's pattern of frequent intercourse.

For test case:

  - input: I'm 51 and have been through the menopause. I haven't had a period in 3 years. Last week, I bled quite heavy for a few days. I just did the blood test. My question is, is the blood testing enough to rule out anything serious? Or should I see a doctor for an internal examination?
  - actual output: At 51 and post-menopause, any unexpected bleeding should definitely be checked out. While blood tests can provide useful information, they usually aren't enough alone to rule out serious issues. I’d recommend seeing your doctor for a thorough evaluation, which may include an internal exam or ultrasound to make sure everything’s okay. It’s best to get it checked sooner rather than later.
  - expected output: postmenopausal bleeding is the vaginal bleeding which occurs 1 year after attaining menopause. it should be evaluated particularly in whom with a family history of carcinoma. pmp bleeding patients are at high risk of endometrial cancer. the causes of pmp bleeding include vaginal atrophy (the most common) hormonal replacement therapy for menopause like tamoxifen endometritis or endometrial infection endometrial hyperplasia endometrial carcinoma cervical polyps cervical carcinoma and any other gynecological carcinoma. better to go for tvus (transvaginal ultrasound scan) pap smear and then endometrial biopsy based on the wall thickness. for further information consult an internal medicine physician

For test case:

  - input: My period has been delayed for three weeks. Till now they are normally regular. Could it be the early onset of menopause or will the period eventually come?
  - actual output: Since your period is delayed by three weeks and you are 50, it's possible that you could be approaching menopause, as cycles can become irregular around this age. However, other factors like stress or hormonal changes can also cause delays. If your period doesn't come soon or if you experience other symptoms, it would be a good idea to check in with your healthcare provider to rule out any other causes and get personalized advice.
  - expected output: if you have been regular with your menses these years and this is the first episode at 50 years of age when the menses have been delayed by two weeks the causes can be a possible initiation of perimenopausal stage where menses are often delayed for a month or two and slowly tend to stop in next one to two years. perimenopausal stage can be verified with the hormonal fsh (follicle stimulating hormone) and lh (luteinizing hormone) levels which if high shall indicate an onset of perimenopausal stage. however it is suggested that pregnancy should anyways be ruled out and if negative then you can wait naturally for your menses to resume. hence try maintaining a menstrual calendar and keep a mark for your dates duration of flow and quantity to evaluate the possible onset of a perimenopausal state. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist

  - expected output: the term medical abortion is used when a medicine is given in order to perform a chemically induced abortion. the results are better if the medication is given earlier. there are various medications that might be used. most of the women would abort within hours but it can also take up to several weeks to complete the abortion. the complications are usually rare. anyway a prolonged bleeding might occur that will need a suction. most doctors and researcher agree that a prior surgical abortion is not a contraindication for a medical abortion. however the medical abortion has to be advised and led by a doctor after a complete examination of the woman.

It also suggests the copper IUD as an alternative, matching the expected output. The advice to consult a healthcare provider is present in both. The only minor shortcoming is the suggestion to avoid breastfeeding for 24 hours after taking the pill, which is not mentioned in the expected output and may be overly cautious, but it does not contradict the main facts. No significant omissions are present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Is emergency contraception pill safe while breastfeeding? If not, then what are the alternative measures?
  - actual output: Emergency contraception pills are generally considered safe to use while breastfeeding, especially the progestin-only type (like the morning-after pill). However, it's a good idea to take it right after feeding and avoid breastfeeding for about 24 hours to minimize any exposure to your baby.

If you're concerned or want alternatives, you could consider using a copper IUD as emergency contraception, which is also safe during breastfeeding and provides ongoing contraception.

For personalized advice, especially while breastfeeding, it's best to consult your healthcare provider.
  - expected output: yes if you want to use it as an emergency contraceptive then it is safe during breastfeeding. you can take but the best contraceptive during breastfeeding is copper-t insertion (intrauterine contraceptive device). for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist

It also appropriately advises consulting a healthcare provider, especially if the bleeding is heavy or painful. However, it omits specific cycle details present in the expected output, such as the user being on day 15 and in the fertile window, and does not reference the exact period dates or cycle length. This omission of detail warrants a deduction, but there are no factual contradictions., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: why am i bleeding right now?
  - actual output: Since your last period ended on April 18 and today is April 29, bleeding now could be unusual for your typical 27-day cycle. It might be spotting or breakthrough bleeding, which can happen for various reasons like hormonal changes, stress, or medication effects (like Provigil or Detrol). However, since you mentioned unusual bleeding, it's a good idea to check in with your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying issues. If the bleeding is heavy or accompanied by pain, please seek medical advice promptly.
  - expected output: It looks like you're currently on day 15 of your cycle and in the fertile window. Your period started on April 14 and lasted until April 18. If you're concerned about bleeding, it's always best to speak with a healthcare provider.

This omission is significant, as it fails to address a likely cause based on the user's history, resulting in a loss of important detail., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: My vulva has been super itchy
  - actual output: Itchy vulva can be caused by things like irritation, infections, or allergies. Since it's been bothering you, it might be a good idea to keep the area clean and avoid any new soaps or products that could be irritating. If the itching persists, worsens, or you notice other symptoms like unusual discharge or pain, I recommend seeing a healthcare provider to get it checked out.

  - ✅ Correctness [GEval] (score: 0.6222700149143158, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly attributes period-related acne to hormonal changes and increased androgens, aligning with the expected output. It also provides general lifestyle advice for managing acne, which is relevant. However, it omits key details from the expected output, such as the typical location of period acne (chin area), the user's age and its relevance, and the mention of antiandrogen therapy as a possible treatment. The omission of these specifics, especially the potential medical intervention and age context, results in a significant loss of detail., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What is happening within our body that causes the most stubborn acne when we were on our period? What is the difference between the acne we get while on our period versus off? What are the best ways (besides specific products) to treat acne specifically during that time?
  - actual output: Hey! The stubborn acne around your period is mostly due to hormonal changes. Right before and during your period, your body produces more androgens (male hormones), which increase oil production in your skin. This extra oil can clog pores and lead to acne. Acne during your period tends to be more inflamed and stubborn compared to acne at other times because of these hormone-driven changes.

Besides using specific skincare products, some good ways to help manage period-related acne include:

- Keeping a consistent gentle skincare routine (cleanse, moisturize)
- Eating a balanced diet with less sugar and dairy if you notice they trigger breakouts
- Managing stress through relaxation or exercise
- Staying hydrated
- Getting enough sleep

If your acne feels severe or painful, it’s a good idea to check in with a dermatologist. Hope this helps!
  - expected output: during menses body releases lots of hormones. these androgens cause stimulation of skin pilosebaceous ducts and lead to acne during the menstruation. these types of acne usually appear in chin area may be because of more concentrated pilosebaceous unit localized to this place. You are also still a teenager, so this is normal to have acne. You could try to maintain hormonal imbalance with the help of antiandrogen to reduce acne during your period, but please consult a dermatologist for further information

The response is generally accurate and does not contradict the context, but lacks the detailed risk breakdown and personal context provided in the expected output., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: can i become pregnant after having intercourse during my period?
  - actual output: Yes, it's possible to become pregnant from intercourse during your period, though it's less likely. Since your cycle is about 24 days and you ovulate around day 11, sperm from intercourse during your period could survive long enough to meet an egg once you start ovulating. If you're trying to avoid pregnancy, it's best to use protection or avoid sex during your fertile window. If you have more questions or concerns, consulting a healthcare provider is a good idea!
  - expected output: if you are having normal periods (4-5 days) that you usually have then you can never become pregnant by having unprotected sex during your periods. however you have a short of 24 days and menstruate for 7 days, then you need to be careful on the last 2 days of those 7 days. You have been having lots of sex, so try to be extra careful. I hope this helps.

  - expected output: you have been diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (bacterial vaginal infection). metronidazole cream has to be applied vaginally for cure of the infection. vaginal application leads to absorption of metronidazole but it is only 2% of the oral dose. only a small amount out of this gets into breast milk. your question about the breastfeeding is pertinent but you are going to use the cream only for 5 days. perhaps you can avoid breastfeeding your child during this period. no major study has given a clear answer regarding the safety and ill effects of the drug in such a situation. consult a paediatrician for further follow up regarding an alternative diet for your child during this period.
