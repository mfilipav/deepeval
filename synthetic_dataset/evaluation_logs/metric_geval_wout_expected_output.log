However, it then contradicts this by expressing a hypothetical preference for being a 'proud caucasian woman,' which is inappropriate and introduces unnecessary bias. This does not directly contradict user data in the context, but it is factually inconsistent and problematic. The rest of the message is polite and offers help, but the major shortcoming is the inappropriate hypothetical statement.

It suggests possible causes (spotting, hormonal changes, medication effects) that align with the user's medications (Provigil, Detrol) in the context. There are no contradictions with the context or expected output, and the advice to consult a healthcare provider is appropriate given the context flag for unusual bleeding.

Reason: The actual output provides specific dates and details about the user's last period, but there are factual inconsistencies with the context. The context states the period started on 2025-04-14 and ended on 2025-04-18 (5 days), while the output says it started on 2025-04-13 and ended on 2025-04-19 (4 days). The reported bleeding intensity (11) is slightly higher than the mean in context (10.17), and the cycle length (27 days) matches the context. The output does not contradict user data in a major way but contains minor factual inaccuracies regarding dates and duration, warranting a moderate penalty.

Reason: The response correctly states that emergency contraception pills, particularly progestin-only types, are generally safe while breastfeeding, which aligns with medical consensus. It also appropriately suggests the copper IUD as an alternative and recommends consulting a healthcare provider. However, the advice to avoid breastfeeding for 24 hours after taking the pill is more cautious than most guidelines, which typically state that progestin-only pills do not require interruption of breastfeeding. There is no contradiction with the context, but the minor inaccuracy about breastfeeding timing prevents a perfect score.

  - ✅ Correctness [GEval] (score: 0.977729986117469, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that pregnancy is possible from intercourse during a period, especially given a short cycle length (24 days) and ovulation around day 11, which matches the context. It does not contradict any user data and provides accurate, relevant information based on the provided cycle details., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: can i become pregnant after having intercourse during my period?
  - actual output: Yes, it's possible to become pregnant from intercourse during your period, though it's less likely. Since your cycle is about 24 days and you ovulate around day 11, sperm from intercourse during your period could survive long enough to meet an egg once you start ovulating. If you're trying to avoid pregnancy, it's best to use protection or avoid sex during your fertile window. If you have more questions or concerns, consulting a healthcare provider is a good idea!
  - expected output: if you are having normal periods (4-5 days) that you usually have then you can never become pregnant by having unprotected sex during your periods. however you have a short of 24 days and menstruate for 7 days, then you need to be careful on the last 2 days of those 7 days. You have been having lots of sex, so try to be extra careful. I hope this helps.

For test case:

  - input: I am 38 years old and I am breastfeeding my 1 year old child. I have been diagnosed with bacterial vaginal infection and prescribed metronidazole vaginal cream daily at bedtime for 5 days. Is it safe for me to continue nursing while using that medication?
  - actual output: It's generally considered safe to continue breastfeeding while using metronidazole vaginal cream, as it has minimal absorption and low risk to your baby. However, if you notice any unusual symptoms in your child, or if you have concerns, it's a good idea to check with your doctor or pharmacist to be sure. Take care!
  - expected output: you have been diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (bacterial vaginal infection). metronidazole cream has to be applied vaginally for cure of the infection. vaginal application leads to absorption of metronidazole but it is only 2% of the oral dose. only a small amount out of this gets into breast milk. your question about the breastfeeding is pertinent but you are going to use the cream only for 5 days. perhaps you can avoid breastfeeding your child during this period. no major study has given a clear answer regarding the safety and ill effects of the drug in such a situation. consult a paediatrician for further follow up regarding an alternative diet for your child during this period.

It seems that you've been having a lot of sex lately (30 times in 20 days), you might have an STI.

  - actual output: At 51 and post-menopause, any unexpected bleeding should definitely be checked out. While blood tests can provide useful information, they usually aren't enough alone to rule out serious issues. I’d recommend seeing your doctor for a thorough evaluation, which may include an internal exam or ultrasound to make sure everything’s okay. It’s best to get it checked sooner rather than later.
  - expected output: postmenopausal bleeding is the vaginal bleeding which occurs 1 year after attaining menopause. it should be evaluated particularly in whom with a family history of carcinoma. pmp bleeding patients are at high risk of endometrial cancer. the causes of pmp bleeding include vaginal atrophy (the most common) hormonal replacement therapy for menopause like tamoxifen endometritis or endometrial infection endometrial hyperplasia endometrial carcinoma cervical polyps cervical carcinoma and any other gynecological carcinoma. better to go for tvus (transvaginal ultrasound scan) pap smear and then endometrial biopsy based on the wall thickness. for further information consult an internal medicine physician

  - ✅ Correctness [GEval] (score: 0.9437823499114202, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly considers the user's age (50) and the delayed period, suggesting menopause as a possibility, which aligns with the context. It also mentions other causes like stress and recommends consulting a healthcare provider, which is appropriate. There are no contradictions with the context or expected output. The only minor shortcoming is that it could have referenced the user's history of regular cycles or specific cycle data from the context for a more tailored response., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: My period has been delayed for three weeks. Till now they are normally regular. Could it be the early onset of menopause or will the period eventually come?
  - actual output: Since your period is delayed by three weeks and you are 50, it's possible that you could be approaching menopause, as cycles can become irregular around this age. However, other factors like stress or hormonal changes can also cause delays. If your period doesn't come soon or if you experience other symptoms, it would be a good idea to check in with your healthcare provider to rule out any other causes and get personalized advice.
  - expected output: if you have been regular with your menses these years and this is the first episode at 50 years of age when the menses have been delayed by two weeks the causes can be a possible initiation of perimenopausal stage where menses are often delayed for a month or two and slowly tend to stop in next one to two years. perimenopausal stage can be verified with the hormonal fsh (follicle stimulating hormone) and lh (luteinizing hormone) levels which if high shall indicate an onset of perimenopausal stage. however it is suggested that pregnancy should anyways be ruled out and if negative then you can wait naturally for your menses to resume. hence try maintaining a menstrual calendar and keep a mark for your dates duration of flow and quantity to evaluate the possible onset of a perimenopausal state. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Correctness [GEval] (score: 0.9182425514916535, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response accurately explains that hormonal changes, specifically increased androgens, cause stubborn acne around the period, which aligns with medical understanding and does not contradict any facts in the context or expected output. The advice given (gentle skincare, diet, stress management, hydration, sleep) is general and appropriate for a 16-year-old, with no contraindications based on the user's context. The only minor shortcoming is that it could have referenced the user's age for more tailored advice, but this does not constitute a contradiction or significant omission., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What is happening within our body that causes the most stubborn acne when we were on our period? What is the difference between the acne we get while on our period versus off? What are the best ways (besides specific products) to treat acne specifically during that time?
  - actual output: Hey! The stubborn acne around your period is mostly due to hormonal changes. Right before and during your period, your body produces more androgens (male hormones), which increase oil production in your skin. This extra oil can clog pores and lead to acne. Acne during your period tends to be more inflamed and stubborn compared to acne at other times because of these hormone-driven changes.

Besides using specific skincare products, some good ways to help manage period-related acne include:

- Keeping a consistent gentle skincare routine (cleanse, moisturize)
- Eating a balanced diet with less sugar and dairy if you notice they trigger breakouts
- Managing stress through relaxation or exercise
- Staying hydrated
- Getting enough sleep

If your acne feels severe or painful, it’s a good idea to check in with a dermatologist. Hope this helps!
  - expected output: during menses body releases lots of hormones. these androgens cause stimulation of skin pilosebaceous ducts and lead to acne during the menstruation. these types of acne usually appear in chin area may be because of more concentrated pilosebaceous unit localized to this place. You are also still a teenager, so this is normal to have acne. You could try to maintain hormonal imbalance with the help of antiandrogen to reduce acne during your period, but please consult a dermatologist for further information

It also appropriately notes that individual health factors, such as BMI (which is high in the context), may play a role, and recommends consulting a healthcare provider. The response is specific, accurate, and considers relevant user data, but could have been slightly more explicit about the potential risks associated with high BMI, which is a minor shortcoming., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: i had a surgical-abortion a year ago now am pregnant again but this time iam thinking of having a medical-abortion. is my medical-abortion going to have any trouble because i had a surgical abortion a year ago?
  - actual output: It's generally possible to have a medical abortion after a previous surgical abortion without issues, especially since it has been a year. However, individual health factors like your BMI and medical history can play a role. I recommend discussing this with your healthcare provider to ensure it's safe and to get personalized advice. Take care!
  - expected output: the term medical abortion is used when a medicine is given in order to perform a chemically induced abortion. the results are better if the medication is given earlier. there are various medications that might be used. most of the women would abort within hours but it can also take up to several weeks to complete the abortion. the complications are usually rare. anyway a prolonged bleeding might occur that will need a suction. most doctors and researcher agree that a prior surgical abortion is not a contraindication for a medical abortion. however the medical abortion has to be advised and led by a doctor after a complete examination of the woman.

It also appropriately suggests the copper IUD as an alternative and recommends consulting a healthcare provider. However, the advice to avoid breastfeeding for 24 hours after taking the pill is more cautious than most guidelines, which typically state that progestin-only pills do not require interruption of breastfeeding. There is no contradiction with the context, but the minor inaccuracy about breastfeeding timing prevents a perfect score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Is emergency contraception pill safe while breastfeeding? If not, then what are the alternative measures?
  - actual output: Emergency contraception pills are generally considered safe to use while breastfeeding, especially the progestin-only type (like the morning-after pill). However, it's a good idea to take it right after feeding and avoid breastfeeding for about 24 hours to minimize any exposure to your baby.

If you're concerned or want alternatives, you could consider using a copper IUD as emergency contraception, which is also safe during breastfeeding and provides ongoing contraception.

For personalized advice, especially while breastfeeding, it's best to consult your healthcare provider.
  - expected output: yes if you want to use it as an emergency contraceptive then it is safe during breastfeeding. you can take but the best contraceptive during breastfeeding is copper-t insertion (intrauterine contraceptive device). for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist
