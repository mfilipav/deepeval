  - ❌ Usefullness [MEval] (score: 0.37848572909583644, threshold: 0.6, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1-mini, reason: The response attempts to address the user's question about their last period by providing dates and cycle length, but it contains inaccuracies and inconsistencies with the context. Specifically, the actual output states the last period started on April 13 and ended on April 19, lasting about 4 days, whereas the context shows StartMenses as April 14 and EndMenses as April 18, with a menses length of 5 days. The bleeding intensity is given as 11 in the output, but the context shows a mean bleeding intensity of 10.17 and a total menses score of 11, which may not directly correspond. These factual inaccuracies reduce the clarity and correctness of the answer, leading to a moderate score., error: None)
  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1-mini, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response fully addresses the question without any irrelevant information, providing a clear and focused answer., error: None)

It is clear, focused, and fully relevant to the input., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: My vulva has been super itchy
  - actual output: Itchy vulva can be caused by things like irritation, infections, or allergies. Since it's been bothering you, it might be a good idea to keep the area clean and avoid any new soaps or products that could be irritating. If the itching persists, worsens, or you notice other symptoms like unusual discharge or pain, I recommend seeing a healthcare provider to get it checked out. They can help figure out the cause and suggest the right treatment.
  - expected output: Experiencing an itchy vulva can be really uncomfortable. There are various reasons why this might be happening, such as infections, irritation from products, or skin conditions. It seems that you've been having a lot of sex lately (30 times in 20 days), you might have an STI. Since I can't offer medical advice, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional to figure out the cause and find the right solution.
