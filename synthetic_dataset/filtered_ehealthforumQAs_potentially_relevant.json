        "answer": "as per the description you have undergone repeated surgery for ovarian torsion where the ovary is preserved. this sounds a bit different as in torsion it is a dictum to remove the whole ovary. now as you are having recurrent pain from the ovaries you need an obg consultation right now. there may be possibility of endometriosis which might present with similar feature. you need to have the biopsy of previous operation and only after few blood tests and clinical examination; a definite opinion can be formed. sincerely dr bhattacharyya",

        "answer": "hair loss (alopecia) is a disorder in which the hair falls out from skin areas where it is usually present such as the scalp and body. hair loss can be caused due to multiple factors including genetic factors diet endocrine abnormalities systemic illnesses drug intake and hair shaft abnormalities. in your case since you are having generalised hair thinning on your scalp without any bald spots you may be having androgenetic alopecia or trichodystrophy. treatment of androgenetic alopecia can be done with topical medications like minoxidil or finasteride. conditions that result in trichodystrophy and fragile hair can include exposure to excessive sunlight hair care techniques (such as hot combing and blow drying) and chemical processes (including coloring straightening and perming). avoiding such procedures or sunlight exposure should be the main stay. gentle hair care and use of hair shampoos and conditioners (leave on) can help prevent further damage. regrowth of hair can occur within few months provided repeated damage does not occur. it would be recommended that you consult a dermatologist or a hair specialist and seek additional guidance and proper advice for proper hair care. i hope this helps.",

        "answer": "radioactive iodine (rai) is often chosen for treatment of conditions associated with overactive thyroid including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancers. rai treatment is based on the fact that the thyroid actively accumulates iodine which it uses to produce thyroid hormones required for normal body function. the therapeutic action of rai is via disruption of the function of the thyroid cells - the more radioactive iodine given the more cells cease to function. as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear. in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc. there will be no effect on other organs like kidneys nor any effect on the sexual desire and sexual function. but once the treatment is completed you will need lifelong therapy with thyroxine supplements to prevent hypothyroidism related symptoms.",
