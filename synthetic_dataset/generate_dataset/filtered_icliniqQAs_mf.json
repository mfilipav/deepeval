    "answer": "if you have taken the urine pregnancy test after seven days of missed periods then the results are usually conclusive. you may repeat the test after 48 hours and if it is still negative then you are not pregnant. the delay can possibly be due to stress induced hormonal imbalance especially during this cycle due to stressors which can easily delay your menses. if your menses do not arrive naturally in next one week then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone. a single delayed period is not an indication for infertility workup. repeat the tests and consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist",

    "answer": "you can bleed more sometimes due to irregular menses because of hormonal (chemical) levels of your body and its effect. but you can bleed also due to cervical erosions and infection there. i personally never recommend tampons. because your menstrual blood contains some bacteria and pathogens which can infect. and when you use tampons due to the collected blood it gives a media to growth of that bacteria. the body can resist infection up to a limit and as the limit crosses you get signs and symptoms of infection for which you may have to take treatment. now in your case foul-smelling discharge and discoloration of the discharge are the signs of infection. now i have to see actually where the infection is. so best consult your nearby gynecologist. let him see where the infection is and what type of discharge actually is. and if required then send the discharge for examination. by this we will know the type of infection and can give treatment accordingly. most probably you are having history which seems to be likely bacterial vaginosis. it is a mixed infection. you will need to take the antibiotic course for 10 to 15 days and follow some precautions to avoid recurrence. now as far as antibiotics are concerned i have to see the first type and nature of discharge and smell. so better get consulted nearby for that. kindly keep up the following precautions: do not use tampons. use pads and change more frequently during menses. keep the area around the vagina as dry as possible especially during menses. change underwear more frequently if required. use cotton underwear if possible. drink more water as your urine becomes clear. do clean vaginal area and immediately after urination and after every time you do sex. these will help to avoid recurrence. and firstly complete the drug course to completely eradicate the infection. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist",

I did not think much of it and just used tampons until I was sure it was done. I had sex with my boyfriend and discovered that I was still very much bleeding. The strangest thing is the odor graduated from that bloody smell to a foul odor and the color changed on my tampon. It ranges from dark brown to yellowish to green with dabs of bright red. It is also only drawn into two particular places on the tampon, the right and just a small spot in the left center. The tampon is also never drenched in blood; it is a light flow just in those two areas. I am not experiencing any kind of pain or discomfort at all.

    "answer": "if pregnancy is the concern then the best way to find out is to get a blood serum beta hcg test done. this is a confirmatory test for pregnancy as the urine pregnancy kits may show false positive results. if the levels of hcg are more than 1 or raised then pregnancy is confirmed. if the level is less than 1 then pregnancy is completely ruled out. if the test is positive then you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy for its site which could be intrauterine or possibly in the tubes (ectopic). if the usg shows extrauterine pregnancy then you would require a laparoscopic salpingectomy to remove the damaged tube along with the ectopic. if the pregnancy is intrauterine then you may decide upon continuing the pregnancy. if the test is negative then the possible cause remains uti (urinary tract infection) or a possible pid (pelvic inflammatory disease) or endometriosis. also stress per se can cause derangement of hormonal balance and can cause heavy bleeding inspite of being on continuous progesterone pills. this can be controlled with antifibrinolytics in the absence of pregnancy. for further follow up consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist",

    "question_text": "Hello doctor, I am 21 years old. I decided to contact you because I do not know what to do. I had sex with my husband and then we found out that he had chlamydia infection. Since then I am feeling sick all the time. My stomach was hurting a lot  and I had problems with passing urine and it started to hurt deep inside. I went to a sexual health clinic and I had a test (it came out as negative after one week) and they treated me for chlamydia. I was told to wait for a week for the symptoms to stop, but it was just getting worse and worse. I had heavy bleeding, spotting at times and I was not able to move because of the pain.Those are just some of the symptoms I was having. I came back to the clinic and they thought it could be PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease) and so they treated me for that. But those antibiotics did not help as well. I still have abdominal pain. I can feel something moving and kicking inside me. It is there all the time. I was at the clinic yesterday and I had 2 pregnancy tests. The results came out the same (one clear line and the other one very light). The possibility of me being pregnant is very less because I was taking birth control pills for 2 years and we were always using condoms except one time which was two months ago, but my husband did not ejaculate inside me. I did not have periods for 2 years and that is why the bleeding worried me. I stopped taking birth control pills one week ago because I was worried that it could be pregnancy. I have not had sex since the 1st of January. I read a lot about ectopic pregnancy and the symptoms are the same as what I have been experiencing. I did two pregnancy tests at home and they were negative. The sexual health clinic said that there is a possibility that I might have ectopic pregnancy. I am very scared. It has been two months already and I cannot stand it. What do I do? Am I pregnant?",

    "answer": "your concern is right. the drug serax-d a combination of serratiopeptidase and diclofenac potassium should not be advised in case of pregnancy or with lactation. although it does cause problems like diarrhea bleeding and rash data is lacking regarding safety in such kids. this may be the personal experience of your gynecologist as they may not have seen any bad effects and so they are using it. but according to literature we should not use it. there is no clear indication of this medicine in your case. use of antibiotics and analgesics can heal the wound. so my conclusive advice is to stop serratiopeptidase and continue the rest of the medicine. please discuss my opinion with the treating doctor and stop the medicine with consent. a little advice for the baby's weight; breastfeed her until six months of age. do not use formula feed. after six months start a cereal-based diet to ensure adequate weight gain. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist",

The doctor prescribed Taxim-O 200 (Cefixime) to be taken in the morning and night along with Metrogyl 400 (Metronidazole) three tablets a day and Serax-D (Serratiopeptidase and Diclofenac potassium) to be taken in the morning and night. My wife is currently breastfeeding our 5 months old baby. So, we asked the doctor whether those medications are safe during lactation. She told that it is fine. However, based on what I read on the internet the first two tablets are moderately safe during lactation and may not pose any significant risk to the baby, whereas the third one is contraindicated during lactation. As per the doctor, the third medicine is required for her cure and is safe to take. Can you let me know whether the medications are safe to take during lactation? Can my wife continue breastfeeding normally? Our baby does not take powder milk and was vomiting when we tried bottled milk in the past. We need your valuable inputs.

    "answer": "you have not mentioned the specific site where you get the pain. is it in and around the nipple or is it deep inside? if the pain is in and around the nipple then it is most likely due to faulty technique while feeding. these are the instructions for proper breastfeeding technique: make sure that you insert not only the nipple but the whole areola (the dark colored area around the nipple) into baby's mouth. by this way the nipple lies touching the baby's hard palate while sucking. also do not forget to rest the baby's head in the corner of your elbow. while feeding your baby's tummy should touch your tummy. now considering that you are not doing any faulty technique or posture and still getting the pain deep inside: it could be due to opening of milk ducts each time the baby sucks. also check out if there is any congestion i. e milk clogging in your breast. also see for any crack in your nipple which is very common in the initial days of lactation. examine your breast with the palm of your hand and if you could notice any lump in your breast it could be milk trapped inside. in any of the above reasons you have to visit a gynaecologist as soon as possible. consult a lactation counselor online for further follow up --> <link>",

I was unwell for about a week afterwards with dizzy feel and nausea. I am a 27 year old male. I am trying to improve my symptoms. I have been playing squash for 40 minutes twice in a week over the past six months. I am also undertaking weight and resistance training approximately twice a week. I have virtually cut out all alcohol from my diet and usually getting 7.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep in the night. I have also recently started suffering mild tension headaches. ED is a long standing problem for me. The symptoms have got worse to the point where I have virtually no sexual functioning. I believe I may have a problem with my endocrine system, so I could have a second opinion with you. I have attached my test results for your reference. Please help.",

    "answer": "i understand your concern. i see two problems in your history. let me tell you the reason and solution. birth control pills come in a pack of 21 or 21 active plus seven dummy pills or the single dose of an emergency contraceptive pill. whichever you take will suppress your body's natural hormones. if you forget to take the pill in between or take it haphazardly your natural cycle is out of the track but do not worry as it can be corrected. get a urine pregnancy test done if not done recently. then have the same oral combined birth control pill (21 pills) twice a day for ten days and throw away the last pill. within next 7 to 10 days you will surely have your periods. all these bleeding on and off will disappear and then from the first day of the bleeding have the next packet of 21 pills once at night for 21 days. your bmi (body mass index) is more which is the bigger problem. from your history i presume you to have pcod (polycystic ovarian disease) this is usually associated with obesity irregular menstrual cycles no periods for few months followed by heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses spotting on and off. you develop an extra pad of fat around the mid segment of the body especially waist thighs and breast. excessive body hair growth hair fall dark lower half of the face acne oily face dark skin in the back of the neck inner thighs and under surface of the breast. pcos will not allow ovulation to occur at times and so you cannot get pregnant till treated. it also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. but this has a solution. just delay pregnancy for a few months as your weight has to be reduced. once you reduce your weight you would not need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant and the pregnancy will be healthy. i suggest you try the following to reduce weight. avoid fasting junk food and red meat. reduce snacks in between meals. have low calories and high-fiber diet. do regular exercise aerobics yoga and brisk walking. get your thyroid profile and serum prolactin test done in empty stomach. you can continue the same 21 pills packet to regularize periods till you shed some weight. try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month. do not hurry on weight reduction as it will be difficult to maintain. as soon as you reduce at least 5 kg you will see changes. for further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist",

    "answer": "you should understand the difference between depression and disappointment. disappointment also manifest symptoms as in the case of the depression. were you deeply disappointed in the near past say within one year? you did not have any bad experiences and your family does not have any depression history. that is perfect. you feel numb sad and worthless. feeling irritable and spending more time alone. these are some of depression symptoms but your problem is never depression. from the given symptoms i see this as an attitude problem related to some sort of disappointment. you are just 19. i suggest you forcefully change your habit. do not be alone. be with family members or friends. if you do not have friends then make friends. go outside and socialize. engage in physical activities and outdoor or indoor games. you will have many things to study. do it. divert your attention to more productive creative and positive things rather than brooding yourself worthlessly. i do not see depression now. if you continue the present attitude and behavior further then it could lead to depressive disorder. please do compulsively as i advised. for further information consult a psychiatrist online --><link>",
    "question": "how to confirm depression?",
    "question_text": "Hi doctor, I just wanted to ask a few questions and get an opinion. I have been experiencing symptoms of depression for the last two years and I do not know what to do. I do not want to get my family involved unless I know anything for sure and I do not even know if I have depression. I have not had any bad experiences that would have affected me enough to make me depressed and my family does not have a history of mental illness, which is what makes me waver. I feel numb, sad and worthless most of the time. I have found myself becoming more and more irritable and spending more and more time alone. I do not know whether this is just something my mind has conjured up or there is something actually wrong. I feel mad at myself whenever I think about this as I do not have any reason for feeling the things I feel. Anyway, I was just wondering if it sounds like I have depression or not. I really want to see a doctor, but I want to give my parents some explanation since they do not really understand how bad mental illness can be. Thank you.",

    "answer": "first of all i need to know what was the drug how long you took that medicine and have you felt tolerance to either effect or side effect of that drug? at this stage i like to inform you that with current available medication only two thirds of the patients improve the remaining and the other one third fail to improve even after trial of multiple drugs. the next course of action is decided on the basis of residual symptoms magnitude of improvement comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions tolerability and affordability to name a few. in your case your doctor may be right but if you are taking same medication for more than six weeks then it is time to intervene. if the concentration problem arose after the use of drug then it might be the side effect of drug itself and in that case it needs replacement. if the prescribed drug dose is in lower range side then increasing the drug dose might be the solution. at this stage i would like to tell you that drugs available currentlyt may be used for improving concentration after a detailed history of the patient and review of all previous drugs. i suggest you to approach a psychiatrist either online or in person for correction of your problem. you can also book a slot for an online video chat session i will be happy to help you out.",

    "answer": "masturbation is actually a normal behavior. but it should not be excessive in frequency which may cause fatigue and back pain. you need not see a doctor right now. just divert your thoughts into much important things in life like studying enjoying outdoor sports finding good friends etc. try to reduce the frequency of the practice to about twice or thrice a week. this is the transient period in everyone's life when urge to explore and also trying to experience new things especially sexual pleasure occurs. as you are physically and mentally mature the problems that you are facing now will resolve spontaneously. apart from this as you said proper diet and lifestyle changes are to be followed: eat nutritious foods (encourage fruits vegetable salads nuts cereal sprouts). limit processed and deep fried foods. indulge in outdoor sports which you are interested like swimming etc. sleep adequately at least 7-8 hours as it is much needed for your normal growth too. avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages. just follow these for a month and let me know how do you feel. get back to a sexologist online for further follow up --> <link>",

I have low physical and mental energy as well as lack of clarity in mind and lack of energy to work properly. I feel my breath is hot and there is an imbalance. My earlier stammering problem increased dramatically because of the above side effects. There is depression, lack of interest and enthusiasm. There is no sexual problem and not suffering from erectile dysfunction or other related problems. My immune system is very weak and I am suffering from frequent throat infection if not maintained proper hygiene. When I get throat infection, I feel as if my immune system would use all the energy in the body to fight the infection and above symptoms would increase dramatically. Without thinking that the above problems were due to masturbation, I have undergone many tests such as EEG, heart, vitamins, thyroid hormones, testosterone hormone, throat, sinus, etc., and there was no problem as per the reports. I tried vitamin B complex. Due to which there is slight improvement. I have also decided to abstain from masturbation until recovery. I request you to advice how to recover and gain back the mental energy?",

    "answer": "yes you are right. hypothyroidism can affect the fetal brain development especially in early pregnancy. thyroid hormone is normally very important for many functions of the body. it helps in the early development of the fetus. the brain is one of the parts of early organ development. in early pregnancy fetus mainly depends on mother's thyroid level because fetus itself cannot produce up to around 11 to 12 weeks (three months). there is no data available whether you have taken treatment early and adequately. but yes there is data that hypothyroidism can affect brain development and function in baby permanently and whatever damage occurs is irreversible. if you are taking thyroxine (levothyroxine) 50 mg and the level is this high then you need to increase the dose. and if you have started treatment just now then continue and repeat according to the doctor. as far as termination is concerned that is totally the couple's call. if you are prepared to take care of a mentally handicapped baby and related problems for the rest of life then you can definitely continue. if you are not prepared for that then you can go for termination. first control thyroid level and then try for pregnancy after you have a normal thyroid level. you will have to take tablets for hypothyroidism for the rest of your life. only dose adjustment will be required time to time according to the thyroid level. so the last choice is yours. you know what can happen. if you are ready for it then go for it and do whatever you have to minimize that. get treated for hypothyroidism more aggressively and control as early as possible. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist",

    "answer": "please do not be worried. you have done a right thing by taking emergency contraception pill within 72 hours of last sexual intercourse. you were not likely to menstruate on your actual due date simply because it takes about 5-7 days for bleeding to occur after taking emergency contraception pill. it is also a known side effect of emergency contraception pill that the following menses may be delayed or may be heavy. in case periods do not resume in the next 10 days then you must do a urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. if the test comes as negative then please do not take any medication. just wait for your periods to return till then practise barrier contraception. if the test is positive which is unlikely though keeping in mind that emergency contraception pill does not cause any congenital abnormalities in fetus you would need to make an informed decision as to continue or terminate the pregnancy (which can be done by medical methods in early first trimester after ultrasound scan confirmation). things can be tackled at each step. so please do not panic stress per se can delay your menses further. try to keep yourself relaxed. consult a gynaecologist online for further follow up --> <link>",

    "answer": "the chance of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) by single unprotected intercourse with a hiv positive person is 1/200 to 1/1000. it is very low. she may be negative so she might have asked it. probably the test done was antibodies tests. it is considered as conclusive after three months. you can go for hiv-1 and 2 rna pcr (polymerase chain reaction) at this stage to allay your anxiety. the symptoms are not specific and do not suggest hiv. it may be due to any simple respiratory infection. you can get it examined by an ent specialist to relieve your anxiety about throat infection. for further information consult a hiv aids specialist",

    "question_text": "Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex with an unknown woman hardly for a minute about a month back. After about four days, I got cold and a kind of sore throat, but not exactly sore throat. I got tested for HIV after 15 days and it came back negative. Now, for the past one week, I have a feeling of something stuck in the throat and a constant need to clear the throat. But, I have not experienced any pain or difficulty in swallowing. I am extremely stressed, anxious and in fear of HIV. I am not able to do anything or concentrate on anything for the past one month.

    "answer": "please wait for a week for your period to start. if it does not start by then you will have to do urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. period could have been delayed due to stress. another rare possibility is that of pregnancy. though you mentioned the days you had sex as your infertile days sometimes occasionally ovulation could be delayed making the days fertile. still you had taken emergency pill (though it is highly effective in preventing pregnancy protection offered is not absolute). so there can be little chance of pregnancy which you need to rule out first. if you want to rule out pregnancy earlier you can do blood beta-hcg test negative result of which will rule out pregnancy. other option as i told is to wait for a week. if pregnancy test comes negative and still period does not start you can induce period by taking tablet medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for five days. period generally starts within a week of last dose of tablet. it will not induce period if you are pregnant. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist",
